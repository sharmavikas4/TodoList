# React Todo App with Redux

This is a simple React Todo App built using React with Vite.js and Redux. The app allows users to add tasks to a list, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks. No external storage is used, so all data is stored in the app's state managed by Redux.

### Features

Add tasks: Users can add tasks to the todo list.
Mark tasks as complete: Users can mark tasks as complete by checking the checkbox next to each task.
Delete tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list.

### Technologies Used

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite.js: Fast, opinionated web dev build tool that serves your code via native ES Module imports.
Redux: State management library for JavaScript apps.
